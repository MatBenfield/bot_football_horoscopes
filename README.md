<h2>Aries</h2><p>Retrograde Venus in Aries reminds you that your star player is racist but it's ok as he scores goals</p><h2>Taurus</h2><p>With the descending Mars in your education sector, remember laminated signs of discontent or banter are to be destroyed</p><h2>Gemini</h2><p>falling Pluto and your 10th house. You may worry about Watford's squad player liking their own transfer rumour on instagram</p><h2>Cancer</h2><p>Today's Neptune-Sun conjunction points you to worry about Man Utd's lack of high intensity runs</p><h2>Leo</h2><p>Sun-Uranus alignment gives you motivation to worry about Burnley's squad player liking their own transfer rumour on instagram</p><h2>Virgo</h2><p>rising Neptune in your descendant 6th house. You should rid your team of sideways passing midfielders.</p><h2>Libra</h2><p>Misplaced passing between Jupiter and Moon could breed thoughts that forces you to think about Everton's free-kick routines</p><h2>Scorpio</h2><p>Pluto in your 10th house and Sun in the 12th house brings you to think about Spurs's injured, heavy smoking midfielder</p><h2>Sagittarius</h2><p>With the waning Jupiter sparks a lucky streak, Peter Reid is at the bar and he'll get a round in</p><h2>Capricorn</h2><p>changing Moon and your 9th house. You may consider Burnley inverting their fullbacks</p><h2>Aquarius</h2><p>Opposition between Moon and Venus could result in the need to worry about West Brom trying to utilise the double pivot</p><h2>Pisces</h2><p>Today you will find yourself waving your imaginary card at West Brom</p>
